# neovim-config
This is my Neovim config. The install script is currently not tested, so please make sure everything succeeds when running the script.

Most of the config files are adapted from [here](https://lucasfcosta.com/2019/02/10/terminal-guide-2019.html)

Most of the plugins are also from the awesome talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlR5gYd6um0).
