# neovim-config
This is my Neovim config, hopefully providing script for reinstalling setup

Most of the config files are from [here](https://lucasfcosta.com/2019/02/10/terminal-guide-2019.html).

Most of the plugins are also from the awesome talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlR5gYd6um0).
